<p><strong>2012 Happiness Challenge</strong>: For those of you following the 2012 Happiness Project Challenge, to make 2012 a happier year -- and even if you haven’t officially signed up for the challenge -- welcome! Each week, I post a video about some Pigeon of Discontent raised by a reader. Because, as much as we try to find the <strong>Bluebird of Happiness</strong>, we're also plagued by the <strong>Pigeons of Discontent</strong>.</p>

<p>For the first month of the Pigeons of Discontent videos, my friend Maria helped me out. This was a fun experiment, but we couldn't really get that format to work properly, so I'm switching back to doing the videos solo.</p>

<p> This week's Pigeon of Discontent, suggested by a reader, is: "<strong>I can never get to bed on time</strong>."</p>

<p>
In The Levity Effect: Why it Pays to Lighten Up, Adrian Gostick and Scott Christopher make an interesting argument that “levity” is an extremely effective tool for helping people to work better. An atmosphere of light-heartedness, it turns out, helps people pay attention, eases tensions, and enhances a feeling of connection. </p>

<p>When I read this, I thought, “Well, levity would be tough for me, I’m not particularly funny, and I’m not particularly outgoing.” </p>

<p>But what the authors mean by “levity” is really a sense of <em>lightness</em>. It's less about being funny and more about being able to have fun and see the humorous side of everyday situations—especially difficult situations. </p>

<p>Ah, I thought, I’m trying! The Ninth of my Twelve Commandments is “Lighten up." When I posted sticky notes with key phrases all around my office and apartment, the one I put in the master bathroom read, “Tender and light-hearted.” </p>

<p>Gostick and Christopher include a quiz about workplace levity. Looking at it, I realized that most of my workplaces included these elements, which I’m sure contributed to the positive experience I had everywhere (except for the summer I worked as a waitress at Dos Hombres Mexican restaurant, and zoikes, I did <em>not </em>like that job). </p>

<p>For example, I’d assumed that the atmosphere around the Supreme Court would be serious, thoughtful, and grand. And it was. But in her chambers, Justice O’Connor incorporated several goofy aspects that made it a lot of fun, too. Each Halloween, she required her clerks to decorate elaborate pumpkins, and birthday celebrations were always a big deal, and she took the clerks on a yearly outing (we went fishing). And that sort of thing really did make a difference. </p>

<p>How does your workplace measure up? Take Gostick and Christopher’s quiz: </p>

<p></p>
<blockquote>
	
		New employees are made to feel welcome <br>
		Meetings are positive and light<br>
		We have fun activities at least once a month<br>
		It’s common to hear people laughing around here<br>
		I can be myself at work<br>
		We have a lot of celebrations for special events<br>
		When brainstorming, we like to have fun<br>
		My boss is usually optimistic and smiling<br>
		Customers would call us fun to do business with<br>
		I have a friend at work who makes me laugh<br>
		We have a good time together
</blockquote> 

<p>Does your workplace have "levity," according to this quiz? Do you think it matters? </p>

<p>This is a great list for home, too. For my next book, Happier at Home, I tried several resolutions that were meant to try to bring more levity into my apartment. For instance, I tried to under-react to problems, and it really did help.  </p>

<p>How about you? Have you found that an atmosphere of levity and good humor makes a difference to your workplace or home? Have you found any good strategies to keep things fun and light? </p>

<p>* It's fun to look around Laughing Squid, which "features interesting art, culture, and technology from around the web." </p>

<p>Happiness interview: <strong>Agapi Stassinopoulos</strong>.</p>

<p>Through a mutual friend, I e-met Agapi Stassinopoulos. She has a new book that's just hitting the bookstores, Unbinding the Heart. She grapples with the question of how we can "unbind our hearts" better to experience playfulness, connection, self-expression, and joy. Clearly happiness is at the heart of this challenge.</p>

<p>Gretchen: <strong>What’s a simple activity that consistently makes you happier?</strong><br>
Agapi: Getting together with the people I care for and having an intimate time, where we lovingly share and listen to each other in a safe haven, recharges me and fills my heart. It beats any good therapist! After all, it’s a Greek tradition that around the kitchen table, through food, laughter, and a little bit of wine, all sorts of problems can get resolved. Your heart gets nurtured and your spirit gets lifted.</p>
<p><strong>What’s something you know now about happiness that you didn’t know when you were 18 years old?</strong><br>
Now I know that my happiness is generated from inside myself. My happiness is not dependent on what I get from the outside world, but more about what I can bring to the world.
<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Is there anything you find yourself doing repeatedly that gets in the way of your happiness?<br>
The two main things that get most in my way of happiness are worrying and pressure. Sometimes, I start to worry about the outcome of things, rather than projecting positively into the future, and finding happiness in the present. It’s a terrible habit that I catch myself doing, and I try to course correct the moment I recognize it. Other times, I pressure myself to do more, to be more…It’s the “more” obsession. There is only one remedy, which is to call myself back into the present and to be grateful.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a happiness mantra or motto that you’ve found very helpful? (E.g., I remind myself, “No calculation.”) Or a happiness quotation that has struck you as particularly insightful?</strong><br>
My mantra is “I am fully present with myself wherever I am.” Like my mother used to say, “give your full attention to whatever it is you are doing.”</p>
<p><strong>If you’re feeling blue, how do you give yourself a happiness boost?</strong><br>
I light some candles, get cozy in bed with my favorite comforter. I read anything I want to, listen to audio books or spiritual seminars, talk to my friends on the phone, or watch movies.  There’s nothing like the comfort of my bed and my fluffy pillows to restore me to my happiness.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything that you see people around you doing or saying that adds a lot to their happiness, or detracts a lot from their happiness? </strong><br>
I think what detracts from a lot of people’s happiness is that they separate from each other and shut down, instead of opening up and embracing each other.</p>
<p><strong>Do you work on being happier? If so, how?</strong><br>
My remedy for my happiness is to listen to myself. If I’m too tired, I put myself to bed. If I’m hungry, I make sure I eat the things that are nurturing for me. If somebody I am talking to is depleting my energy, I stay away from that person. I try to keep the people who are nurturing and uplifting close to me. I freely express feelings and do not censor myself. Definitely sharing the joy and the light randomly with people brings me a lot of happiness. All these are factors that contribute to a high level of taking care of myself, so I can then contribute more to other people’s happiness. Attending to myself is something that I have worked hard at over time to make into a positive habit. </p>

<p>Partly as an intellectual discipline, partly for fun, I often push myself to answer tough, conclusory questions, such as "If you had to pick just <em>one thing</em>, what's <em>the </em> key to happiness?" or "What are the ten most common myths about happiness?"</p>

<p>The other day, I asked myself: <strong>If I had to state the central challenge of living a life of happiness, in a single sentence, what would it be</strong>? This sentence, I decided, would be a good candidate:</p>

<p></p>

<p>As Flannery O'Connor observed in a letter, "Accepting oneself does not preclude an attempt to become better."</p>

<p>Just about anyone who has ever put off a troublesome task is familiar with one of my Secrets of Adulthood: <strong>Working is one of the most dangerous forms of procrastination</strong>. </p>

<p>When there’s some chore you just don’t want to tackle, every other chore seems alluring. As a friend told me, “My apartment is never cleaner than when I have a writing assignment due.” </p>

<p>In Roy Baumeister and John Tierney’s fascinating book, Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength, they suggest the “Nothing Alternative” to this problem. That is, <strong>if you want to get yourself to do something, make the alternative to that task to <em>do nothing</em></strong>.</p>

<p>This rule was inspired by the habits of writer Raymond Chandler. Chandler set aside at least four hours each day for writing; he didn’t force himself to write, but he didn’t let himself do anything else. He wouldn’t let himself read, write letters, write checks—nothing. He summed up: “Two very simple rules, a. you don’t have to write. b. you can’t do anything else. The rest comes of itself.”</p>

<p>When I read this, I realized that I’d been following this rule without giving it a name. When I want to do the difficult work of original writing, I often work outside my apartment, in a library a few blocks away. This gets me away from the temptations of the internet, and it also forces me to accept the “nothing alternative.” I say to myself, “I’ll stay here for two hours,” and then I’m stuck. If I’m not writing, I’m just sitting there. Sure, sometimes I jump up and go look for a book in the stacks, but that doesn’t take long. I end up writing just to pass the time. At home, by contrast, there’s no end to the useful tasks that I can find to occupy myself.</p>

<p>So if you often find yourself procrastinating by working, try making yourself <em>do nothing</em>. </p>

<p>How about you? Do you procrastinate by working—by cleaning, organizing, answering emails, cruising the internet doing “research,” making plans, or the like? Has the "do nothing" alternative worked for you? </p>

<p><em>I’m working on my Happiness Project, and you could have one, too! Everyone’s project will look different, but it’s the rare person who can’t benefit. Join in -- no need to catch up, just jump in right now. Each Friday’s post will help you think about your own happiness project.</em></p>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Assay: Recently, when I was rereading Gertrude Stein's The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, I was very struck by this observation about the French poet Guillaume Apollinaire:  </p>

<p></p>
<blockquote>
	The death of Guillaume Apollinaire at this time made a very serious difference to all his friends apart from their sorrow at his death. It was the moment just after the war when many things had changed and people naturally fell apart. Guillaume would have been a bond of union, he always had a quality of keeping people together, and now that he was gone everybody ceased to be friends. 
</blockquote>

<p>The "quality of keeping people together" seems an important and rare attribute, and although it doesn't come naturally to me, I'm trying to do a better job of it myself, and also to appreciate more the work of the Apollinaire-ish types whose efforts benefit me.</p>

<p>This quality has been on my mind since the sad occasion of a memorial service of a friend. I knew her in a work context, but at the service, I realized from the tributes of her college friends that, along with many other wonderful traits, she had the "quality of keeping people together" from that time.  </p>

<p>My sister is this way, too, and from watching her in action, I know how much energy and time it takes to act like glue, to make the efforts that allow people to stay close.</p>

<p>Who coaxes people into showing up to the reunion? Who remembers everyone's birthdays, and insists that everyone get together to mark the occasion? Who plans the promotion celebration? Who organizes the group wedding gift? Who keeps track of everyone's addresses? Who sends out the group emails? It doesn't sound very hard—until you're the one doing it.</p>

<p>And although it's a lot of work, it's all too easy for people to take these efforts for granted, or not to realize how important one person is to the strength of a particular web of relationships. In fact, that person might well be teased for these efforts, and instead of people being appreciative and cooperative, they might act jaded and superior to such gung-ho antics.</p>

<p>Ancient philosophers and contemporary scientists agree: one of the keys—perhaps <em>the</em> key—to happiness is strong relationships, and the often unsung work of such folks to keep up a "bond of union" makes a tremendous difference to everyone in their circles. </p>

<p>How about you? Do you have the "quality of keeping people together"? Do you feel that your efforts are appreciated? If you don't naturally play this role, have you found strategies to work at it? </p>

<p>* I love cruising around Parent Hacks—which "collects and shares parents' tips, recommendations, and bits of wisdom—their hacks—so we can all benefit."</p>

<p>As a result of my happiness project, I've become a sleep zealot. It's just so obvious to me—from reading the research and from personal experience—that getting enough sleep is a key to a happier life.</p>

<p>I've noticed something, however. I noticed this in myself, before I became such a sleep nut, and I see it in the people around me: most adults don't give themselves a bedtime.</p>

<p>Children have a fixed bedtime; we know they need their allotment of sleep, and we pack them off to bed when it's time. But many adults just go to bed whenever they feel like it.</p>

<p>The problem with this approach is that it's far too easy to stay up too late. The TV, the internet, your email, your book...these distractions keep you alert past the point at which you should head to bed. Many of us know we ought to go to sleep sooner, but we just can't manage to pull it off.</p>

<p>One suggestion: <strong>Give yourself a bedtime</strong>. Even if you don't actually go to bed on time, at the very least, you should know that you're "staying up past your bedtime." Just the realization that it's an hour past your "bedtime" might help you nudge yourself into bed. Most adults should get 7-8 hours of sleep each night, so do the math.</p>

<p>I get up at 6:00 am, which means my bedtime is 10:30 pm. When I first gave myself a bedtime, I was in the habit of going to bed around 11:30 or midnight. I thought that was an appropriate grown-up bedtime. Well, it's not if you're a grown-up who gets up at 6:00! </p>

<p>For me, at least, getting more sleep was a habit that was self-reinforcing. I felt so, so much better when I started getting enough sleep that it was very easy to observe that bedtime, even though I do regret the loss of those leisure hours.</p>

<p>How do you know if you're not getting enough sleep? Some warning signs:</p>
<ul>
<li>you're jolted out of sleep by your alarm clock every morning</li>
	<li>you fall asleep any time you find yourself in a quiet, still place (in a movie theater, or rocking your child)</li>
	<li>you sleep-binge on the weekends</li>
	<li>you feel exhausted all the time </li>
<li> on the day when Daylights Savings Time gives you an extra hour of sleep, you feel <em>amazing</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Try it. Don't even attempt to go to bed earlier. Just identify your bedtime. We tend to manage what we measure, and by identifying a specific bedtime, you might find yourself developing the habit of turning off the light earlier.</p>

<p>Do you have a regular bedtime, or not? If so, how much sleep do you get, and when do you turn off the light?</p>

<p>Cruising around Pinterest (my new toy), I came across this list of Henry Miller's eleven work commandments, posted by Sadie Skeels. I'm astounded by how absolutely apt these commandments are for my own writing practices.</p>

<p>For instance, #10. I struggle with this problem <em>all the time</em>. And #2. I remember a conversation I had with my agent when I was writing Forty Ways to Look at Winston Churchill. I was so enthralled with the material that I couldn't stop researching, and finally she said to me sternly, "<em>No more research</em>." #5 is terrific advice; when I can't seem to write, I can review my notes, edit, cut...and pretty soon I've started writing again. I think about #11 in a different way; I struggle to make sure that writing doesn't crowd out other things that are also important to me.</p>

<p>Henry Miller's Commandments, from Henry Miller on Writing:</p>
<blockquote>
	
	<p>1. Work on one thing at a time until finished.<br>
	2. Start no more new books, add no more new material to “Black Spring.”<br>
	3. Don’t be nervous. Work calmly, joyously, recklessly on whatever is in hand.<br>
	4. Work according to Program and not according to mood. Stop at the appointed time!<br>
	5. When you can’t <em>create </em>you can <em>work</em>.<br>
	6. Cement a little every day, rather than add new fertilizers.<br>
	7. Keep human! See people, go places, drink if you feel like it.<br>
	8. Don’t be a draught-horse! Work with pleasure only.<br>
	9. Discard the Program when you feel like it–but go back to it the next day. <em>Concentrate.  Narrow down. Exclude</em>.<br>
	10. Forget the books you want to write. Think only of the book you <em>are </em>writing.<br>
	11. Write first and always. Painting, music, friends, cinema, all these come afterwards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These rules seem helpful to non-writers as well; in almost everything we do, it helps to stay focused, refreshed, and perseverant.</p>

<p>What work commandments would you add? And what exactly do you think that Miller meant by #6?</p>

<p>* As I mentioned, I'm really enjoying Pinterest—"an online pinboard where you can organize and share the things you love." If you'd like me to send you an invitation, drop me a request at gretchenrubin1@gretchenrubin.com.</p>

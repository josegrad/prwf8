<p>One consequence of my happiness project is that I've grown to love numbered lists. My 12 Personal Commandments. My 8 Splendid Truths. The 10 Myths about happiness.</p>

<p>Buddhism has many numbered lists—the Triple Refuge, the Noble Eightfold Path, the Four Noble Truths—which is surprising to me, given Buddhism's emphasis on gateless gates and transcending the bounds of rational thinking. There’s a koan to be written about that paradox, for sure. Let's see...how about, “Use numbers to throw away enumeration.”</p>

<p>I particularly love Buddhism's eight auspicious symbols: </p>

<p></p>
<blockquote>
	<strong>1. Parasol <br>
	2. Golden fish<br>
	3. Treasure vase<br>
	4. Lotus<br>
	5. Conch shell<br>
	6. Endless knot<br>
	7. Victory banner<br>
	8. Wheel of Dharma</strong>
</blockquote>

<p>I made up a list of my eight auspicious symbols:</p>

<p></p>
<blockquote>
	<strong>1. Bluebird (of course)<br>
	2. Ruby slippers (what I want is already within my grasp)<br>
	3. Dice (chance and fortune)<br>
	4. Blood. (hard to explain: diabetes, hepatitis C, St. Therese of Lisieux)<br>
	5. Gold star (my right actions are their own reward)<br>
	6. Holstein cow (my family, Kansas City)<br>
	7. Peacock feather (symbols beyond words)<br>
	8. Birdhouse (for reasons soon to be revealed!)</strong>
</blockquote>

<p>This is so satisfying, I could keep going with more symbols. How about you? What would you choose for your auspicious symbols, and why?</p>

<p>Assay: I’m not a huge fan of Andy Warhol’s visual art, but I’m a devoted fan of his writing. (Sidenote: it’s striking how many visual artists are brilliant writers, for instance, I love Eugene Delacroix’s Journal and Edward Weston’s Daybooks). </p>

<p>What interests me about Andy Warhol is that he makes seemingly obvious observations in very simple language—and yet, upon reflection, I often realize that he has managed to articulate something very subtle. As one of my Secrets of Adulthood holds: It’s very important, and surprisingly difficult, to grasp the obvious.</p>

<p>For instance, I read this passage from The Philosophy of Andy Warhol: (From A to B and Back Again) several weeks ago, and while it didn’t particularly grab my attention while I was reading it, I find my thoughts repeatedly returning to it. The more I think about this observation, the more profound it becomes.</p>

<p>Andy Warhol wrote: </p>

<p><strong><blockquote>
	When I think about what sort of person I would most like to have on a retainer, I think it would be a boss. A boss who could tell me what to do, because that makes everything easy when you’re working.
</blockquote></strong></p>

<p>That’s it, I keep thinking. That’s it! I wish <em>I</em> could have a boss on retainer. (Note Warhol's nuance of having a boss "on retainer.") </p>

<p>As the boss of myself, I often wish I had someone to set my priorities, to give me assignments to start and finish, and to tell me how to improve—or better yet, to give me some gold stars.</p>

<p>Telling myself what to do, and then doing what I have to do…it's challenging. Self-command isn't easy. How about you? Do you ever wish you had a boss on retainer? Even if you already have a permanent, real boss.</p>

<p>I love reading Carl Jung, especially his book Memories, Dreams, Reflections. His work is very challenging, however, so to get a Jung fix, I read a bunch of interviews that he gave, which were printed in the collection, C.G. Jung Speaking.</p>

<p>In 1960, journalist Gordon Young asked Jung, "What do you consider to be more or less basic factors making for happiness in the human mind?" Jung answered with five elements:</p>

<p></p>
<blockquote>
	<strong>1. Good physical and mental health.<br>
	2. Good personal and intimate relationships, such as those of marriage, the family, and friendships.<br>
	3. The faculty for perceiving beauty in art and nature.<br>
	4. Reasonable standards of living and satisfactory work.<br>
	5. A philosophic or religious point of view capable of coping successfully with the vicissitudes of life.</strong>
</blockquote>

<p>Jung, always mindful of paradox, added, “All factors which are generally assumed to make for happiness can, under certain circumstances, produce the contrary. No matter how ideal your situation may be, it does not necessarily guarantee happiness.” </p>

<p>I did disagree strongly with Jung on one point. He said, “<strong>The more you deliberately seek happiness the more sure you are not to find it</strong>." I know, Carl Jung vs. Gretchen Rubin, who is the authority? But though many great minds, such as John Stuart Mill, make the same point as Jung, I don't agree.</p>

<p>For me, at least, the more mindful I am about happiness, the happier I become. Take Jung's  five factors. By deliberately seeking to strengthen those elements of my life, I make myself happier. </p>

<p>What do you think of Jung's list? Would you add anything else, or characterize any element differently? And do you think it's helpful to think about happiness directly, or not?</p>

<p>* Several months ago, I posted an interview with the writer and humorist <strong>Andy Borowitz</strong>, and I also linked the podcast of a story he told, The time I almost died (a true story). Because people responded so warmly to the story, I suggested to Andy that he might consider publishing it in written form—and he has! An Unexpected Twist is the <strong>#1 Kindle Single</strong>. It's hilarious and also deeply moving. I love any gold star, so I have to admit I got a huge kick when, in an interview on the New Yorker site, Andy mentioned that I'd given him a nudge to write it.</p>

<p>When I started thinking about happiness, several quotations made a special impression:</p>

<p><strong>"The best way to cheer yourself is to try to cheer somebody else up."</strong> Mark Twain</p>
                      
<p><strong>“There is no duty we so much underrate as the duty of being happy.”</strong> Robert Louis Stevenson (I ended up using this quotation as an epigraph to The Happiness Project.) </p>
                         
<p><strong>"Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things: But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her."</strong> Luke 10:41-42</p>

<p><strong>“Imaginary evil is romantic and varied; real evil is gloomy, monotonous, barren, boring. Imaginary good is boring; real good is always new, marvelous, intoxicating.”</strong> Simone Weil</p>

<p><strong>“What a wonderful life I’ve had! I only wish I’d realized it sooner.” </strong>Colette</p>

<p><strong>“It is easy to be heavy: hard to be light.”</strong> G.K. Chesterton (This is true on so many levels.)</p> 
                       
<p><strong>“A man’s first care should be to avoid the reproaches of his own heart.” </strong>Joseph Addison</p>

<p><strong>“Order is Heaven’s first law.”</strong> Alexander Pope</p>

<p>Happiness interview: Gabrielle Blair.</p>

<p>I've admired Gabrielle Blair's blog Design Mom—"at the intersection of design and motherhood"—for a long time. (Clearly I'm not the only one who likes it, because it was named a top website of 2010 by <em>Time </em>magazine.) Gabby is a designer, the mother of six children, and lives in a farmhouse in the French countryside, and those are the things she writes about. </p>

<p>I finally got to meet Gabby in person last month, at her terrific Alt Design Summit. Gabby is someone who has obviously made a very careful study of what makes her happy, and worked hard to bring those elements into the forefront of her life, so I was curious to hear what she had to say on the subject of happiness.</p>

<p>Gretchen: <strong>What’s something you know now about happiness that you didn’t know when you were 18 years old?</strong> <br>
Gabrielle: Everything's better if I have enough sleep. There were years, probably for us all, where sleep didn't matter as much as it seems to count today. It never once won a contest between a late night with friends or just one more kiss from Ben Blair. I could catch up on sleep tomorrow or the next day. But now I'm lucky enough to have a lot more people in my life and care—six, to be exact!—all of whom love it to the moon when I'm smiling, laughing, dancing in the kitchen, or coming up with a glittery, gluey afternoon project. When I'm exhausted, I'm one step behind, smiles are hard to come by, I don't dance, and making a mess is the last thing I want to do. </p>

<p>It's the same story professionally, as well. Projects tackled on very little sleep take twice as long, make me twice as tired, and often end up flat and uninspired. A good night's sleep is a treasure, and I never feel guilty about sneaking in an extra hour or two whenever and wherever I can!</p>

<p><strong>Is there a happiness mantra or motto that you’ve found very helpful? (e.g., I remind myself to “Begin <em>now</em>.”) Or a particular book that has stayed with you?</strong><br>
Ox-Cart Man is my favorite picture book of all time. It's calming and reassuring. It reflects a work ethic I like and hold as my own standard; work really hard, and then benefit from your work. The seasonal, cyclical theme resonates hard with me, too. There's a time for everything. There really is. And another chance will come next time around. It really will.</p> 

<p>A stillness falls over me when I turn that last page, and everything in my life somehow suddenly feels like a gift. I read it, and like magic I restart enjoying the smallest pleasures and tiniest luxuries, like one perfect peppermint candy that lasts exactly long enough.</p>

<p><strong>If you’re feeling blue, how do you give yourself a happiness boost? Or, like a “comfort food,” do you have a comfort activity? (mine is reading children’s books).</strong><br>
Sex! Luckily, I adore my husband and we both work from home. We make an effort to steal away as often as we can, which is sometimes a trick when you live with lots of little people, but it's so worth it. Always. Sharing a connection, feeling loved and loving, burning off the calories from the tarts I can't seem to resist from our local patisserie...it's all pretty wonderful.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything that you see people around you doing or saying that adds a lot to their happiness, or detracts a lot from their happiness? </strong><br>
The happiest, most content people I know in my own life are actively creative in some way, shape, or form. Creativity looks different on each of us, right? We may not all be painters whose art is on display in a Parisian gallery or designers whose clothes we all dream of wearing, but if we're expressing our talents and nurturing our interests, you can bet the house that happiness is happening. </p>

<p>Someone else is always going to be doing something more interesting, more innovative, more everything; it's the beauty of living in this big, creative world of ours, isn't it? So jealousy or feelings of inadequacy are perfectly natural, but that doesn't mean they have to stick. For me, that first pang of envy is a not-to-be-ignored signal that I need to get inspired and be inspiring. The simple act of sketching out an impossible idea, gathering up the ingredients for a decadent dessert, learning how to work a new setting on my camera, or even organizing a drawer are all perfect antidotes.</p>

<p><strong>Do you work on being happier? If so, how?</strong><br>
I guess I work hard on anything that's important to me, and happiness tops every list. Over the past few years, I've realized how much of me feeling happy is a choice. I'm still just figuring it out, but I try my best to make that choice every hour of every day. When I'm feeling negative emotions, I take responsibility for them and acknowledge that I can actively choose to feel happier that very minute. That very minute! How empowering is that?</p> 

<p>I can usually create a clean slate in my mind if I sit still for a moment and offer up a quick, silent prayer. I try to envision how I would be behaving if I was happy. Then I do my best to behave that way. It sounds simple, but most of the best ideas in life are! </p>

<p>Really, life is so much more enjoyable when I'm happy. It makes my skin glow, too. </p>

<p><strong>Have you ever been surprised that something you expected would make you very happy, didn’t—or vice versa?</strong><br>
I have to drag myself outside for chores, procrastinating like crazy to avoid it all.Shoveling piles and piles of snow? I'd rather enjoy the all-white view from inside, preferably armed with a mug of hot cocoa and a roaring fire. Prune the rose bushes? Ouch. Weed the garden? No, thank you. But as soon as I get out there and start, I don't want to stop!</p>

<p>There's beauty in tasks like that, though. Try not to smile when you think of a freshly-shoveled walk, or when the roses seem to multiply overnight. And pulling a carrot from the dirt or plucking a ripe tomato that grew from next-to-nothing? Breathtaking. Even though I perpetually forget it, these tasks have a beautiful effect on my immediate world, and I actually really enjoy yard work.</p>

<p><strong>2012 Happiness Challenge</strong>: For those of you following the 2012 Happiness Project Challenge, to make 2012 a happier year -- and even if you haven’t officially signed up for the challenge -- welcome! Each week, I post a video about some Pigeon of Discontent raised by a reader. Because, as much as we try to find the <strong>Bluebird of Happiness</strong>, we're also plagued by the <strong>Pigeons of Discontent</strong>.</p>

<p> This week's Pigeon of Discontent, suggested by a reader, is: "<strong>Why am I always late?</strong>" </p>

<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about my eating habits lately—probably because the holiday season is so full of temptation. Here are some guidelines that I’ve been trying to follow, whether eating in or eating out, with various degrees of fidelity.</p>

<p>1. <strong>Wear snug-fitting clothes</strong>.</p>

<p>2. <strong>Buy food in small containers</strong>. Studies show that people give themselves larger portions out of larger boxes, so I don’t buy that economy box of whatever.</p>

<p>3. <strong>Make tempting food inconvenient</strong>—put cookies in a hard-to-reach spot, set the freezer to a very cold temperature so it’s hard to spoon out ice cream, store goodies in hard-to-open containers.</p>
<p>
4. <strong>Order the appetizer size</strong>.</p>

<p>5. <strong>Use smaller plates, bowls, and cutlery</strong>. I often use the plastic plates we have left over from when my daughters were young.</p>

<p>6. <strong>Dish food up in the kitchen</strong>, and don’t bring serving platters onto the table (except vegetables).</p>

<p>7. Pile my plate with everything I intend to eat, and <strong>don’t get seconds</strong> once that food is gone. (I can do this with everything except my favorite Thanksgiving food, served every year in my family: sweet potatoes with marshmellows.)</p>

<p>8. <strong>Keep serving sizes small</strong>: get a small frozen yoghurt instead of a large (ok, I would get a medium not a small, but still); get a single hamburger instead of a double.</p>

<p>9. <strong>Skip the add-ons</strong>: tell the waiter that I don’t want the side of fries, don’t add croutons or bacon to my salad. I feel like Sally from When Harry Met Sally as I quibble about how my food should be served, but oh well.</p>

<p>10. After dinner, signal myself that “<strong>Eating’s over</strong>”: brush my teeth, clean up the kitchen, turn out the lights.</p>

<p>11. <strong>Don’t allow myself to get too hungry or too full</strong>.</p>

<p>12. Realize that, with some things, <strong>I can’t have just a little bit</strong>. In the abstainer/moderator split, I'm a hard-core abstainer. It’s far easier for me to skip cookies, bagels, and chocolate than it is to have a sensible portion.</p>

<p>13. <strong>Never eat hors d’oeuvres</strong>.</p>

<p>14. <strong>Don't eat food I don't like</strong>, just because it's there. No one cares if I have a serving of asparagus or cranberry sauce.</p>

<p>I've realized that although it seems festive and carefree to indulge in lots of treats, in the end, I feel guilty and overstuffed. Which doesn't make the holiday happier. It's a Secret of Adulthood: <strong>By giving myself limits, I give myself freedom</strong>.</p>

<p>Assay: I'm a huge fan of Twilight (books and movies)—a fact about myself that continues to fascinate and puzzle me. Last night, I went to see the fourth movie in the <em>Twilight</em> series, Breaking Dawn, which inspired me to look back at a post I wrote two years ago. I really love that post, so here it is again.</p>

<p>* <br>
Following my resolution to Enter into other people’s interests, last week I watched the movie Twilight with my older daughter. This wasn’t a sacrifice for me; I love Stephenie Meyer's books (oh, how I love children’s and young-adult literature), so I was curious to see the movie.</p>

<p>I found the movie interesting for many reasons not relevant here (other than to say I’m thinking about Jung generally, Frazier’s The Golden Bough, and George Orwell’s discussion of “good bad poetry” in his essay, “Rudyard Kipling”), but in particular, I loved the depiction of wordless, instantaneous, passionate love.</p>

<p>Many of my happiness-project resolutions are meant to help me be more tender, more loving, more-lighthearted, more appreciative…more romantic.</p>

<p>My husband and I met when we were in law school. I still remember the first time I saw him walk into the library—a shock ran through me, and I could practically feel my pupils dilate. He was wearing jeans and a rose-colored Patagonia pull-over (which I still keep in my closet). I walked over to a friend and whispered casually, “Who is that guy?”</p>

<p>Our law school is small, and our social circles magically started to overlap, so I met him, and my crush deepened. One important night, we sat next to each other at a dinner party. There was that afternoon when we ran into each other on the law-school staircase in front of the stained-glass windows.</p>

<p>But he had a girlfriend, and I had a boyfriend. Then he broke up with his girlfriend. A week later, on May 1 (I just looked up the exact date in my calendar), I broke up with my boyfriend. It happened in the morning, and I went out into the courtyard and made a general announcement of the break-up to a bunch of friends—to see what his reaction would be.</p>

<p>No reaction. “Hmmmm,” I thought. “Maybe I misread this situation.” Had I imagined what I thought was between us? After all, the two of us had never talked about anything of importance, certainly not about “us”; we’d never spent any time alone, only in chaperoned groups (except that once he’d asked me to breakfast at the Copper Kitchen before our Corporations class, an occasion so thrilling to me in prospect that I slept only a few hours the night before); and neither of us had ever made even the smallest romantic overture toward each other.</p>

<p>But that same afternoon after my break-up, he told me he was going to walk to Wawa’s (the New Haven version of QuikTrip) to get a Coke, and did I want to come? I did. We walked to Wawa’s, then back to the law school, and sat on a bench beneath some blooming magnolia trees. He said something completely incoherent, then took my hand; this was the first time we ever touched. At that moment, if he’d asked me to marry him, I wouldn’t have been at all surprised, and I might well have said “Yes.” (We did get engaged several months later.)</p>

<p>Now, so many years later, is it the same? Yes and no. Yes, because I still love him passionately, and more deeply, because I know him so much better. No, because he pervades my entire life, so now sometimes it’s hard to see him. Married people are so intertwined, so interdependent, so symbiotic, that it’s hard to maintain that sense of wonder and excitement.</p>

<p>If I’ve learned one thing from my happiness project, it’s that if I want my life to be a certain way, I must be that way <em>myself</em>. If I want my marriage to be tender and romantic, <em>I</em> must be tender and romantic.</p>

<p>Am I tender and romantic? Am I appreciative, thoughtful, forbearing, fun-loving? Or do I march around the apartment snapping out reminders and orders? Am I quick to feel annoyed or aggrieved? When we first met, I honestly wondered whether it would ever be possible for me to read when we were sitting in a room together; I found it so hard to concentrate that I couldn’t make sense of anything more complicated than the newspaper. Now, I find it hard to tear myself away from my work and my email to hold up my end of a marital conversation.</p>

<p>So, inspired by the springtime, and the memories of early love brought back to me by Twilight, I’m going to redouble my usual efforts to keep my resolutions related to love. Think of small treats or courtesies. Leave things unsaid. Give proofs of love. Don’t expect praise. Take time to be silly. Fight right.</p>

<p>Have you found any good ways to stay tender and romantic in a long relationship?</p>

<p>Here, to me, is the great mystery: we’re perfectly suited to each other—but how did we fall in love before we knew each other at all? How is that possible?</p>

<p>* The movie also reminded me to Be Gretchen and accept my taste in music. I loved the song from the Twilight piano scene, "Bella's Lullaby," and instead of dismissing that pleasure, I let myself enjoy it—and in the process, came across this engaging post by the composer Carter Burwell. (To listen to the song, listen to the clip on his post, or this preview.) </p>

<p>It reminds me of another soundtrack song I love, The Promise, from the mind-blowing movie The Piano. The pairing of the two songs/movies is interesting, because The Piano is about wordless passion between adults, with their complications, instead of teenagers.</p>

<p>In crime-fighting, the "broken windows theory" holds that signs of vandalism and petty crime foster more crime and anti-social behavior; fix problems like broken windows, graffiti, or trash when they're small, and people will behave better and remain in their neighborhoods.</p>

<p>This theory is controversial, but whether or not it's true in a municipal context, I've been trying to apply it in my own home, by trying to do a better job of fixing small things right away.</p>

<p>Just yesterday, a light bulb burned out in my office. My instinct would be to put up with this for weeks, while half-heartedly reminding myself to replace the bulb, to little effect; instead, this morning, I marched myself over to the closet where we keep light-bulbs, grabbed one, and swapped them out. </p>

<p>This issue is familiar to me. In college, my roommate and I would joke about the fact that we were the kind of people who, when some very necessary light-bulb in the living room burned out, would just resignedly say to each other, "Oh, well, now we have to learn to live without that light-bulb." It took us forever to take care of those kinds of tasks.</p>

<p>This morning, I got a ridiculous sense of accomplishment from this small act. And now it's done, and won't consume any more precious mental energy.</p>

<p>I find that when the little things in my home are out of order, I feel restless, anxious, and overwhelmed. When I take care of the little things, I feel more ready to tackle the large things.</p>

<p>How about you? Do you find that taking care of seemingly inconsequential tasks makes you feel happier and calmer? Am I the only one who has this strange resistance to light-bulb replacement?</p>

<p>Self-knowledge is crucial to happiness, but it's challenging to know yourself. Sometimes, I find, I can gain insight by asking myself questions that make me take stock of my interests and values.</p>

<p>For that reason, I asked myself, "Who are my patron saints? Of my Happiness Project, in particular, and for myself generally?" (A "patron saint" is a saint who has a special connection to a person, place, profession, or activity, or in more casual terms, a person who serves as a particular leader or example.)</p>

<p>Here are my six patron saints:</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin: practical, curious, inventive.</p>

<p>St. Therese of Lisieux: showing great love through small, ordinary actions.</p>

<p>Samuel Johnson: wildly eccentric, with a deep understanding of human nature.</p>

<p>Julia Child: goofy yet masterly; light-hearted yet authoritative.</p>

<p>Winston Churchill: indefatigable, indomitable.</p>

<p>Virginia Woolf: intensely attuned to the power of the passing moment.</p>

<p>Well, Julia Child and Winston Churchill are probably rarely paired together in the same discussion, but they both represent very powerful ideas to me. It's interesting—the posts I've written about these figures are among my favorites of all the posts I've written. I love thinking and writing about my patron saints.</p>

<p>Who are your patron saints? Why?</p>

<p>* Speaking of Samuel Johnson, my next book takes its title from Johnson. Johnson remarked, "<strong>To be happy <em>at home</em> is the ultimate result of all ambition, the end to which every enterprise and labour tends</strong>." My next book is called Happier at Home. What a pleasure it has been to write this book! If you'd like to be notified when it's available, sign up here.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>I have a lot of trouble remembering people's names. (My husband, on other hand, is freakily good at remembering names and faces -- a very handy virtue in a spouse.) </p>

<p>Also, I often have trouble remembering why someone looks familiar. Several years ago, while at crowded birthday party for a three-year-old, I was on the brink of going over to some little kid’s father to say, “I think we went to college together.” Turns out it was Dylan McDermott!</p>

<p>So I’ve developed some strategies for coping with the fact that I’m not able to pull up a person’s name right away. Of course, you can always just say politely, "I'm sorry, I don't recall your name," but if you'd rather try to disguise your forgetfulness, give these a try:</p>

<p>1. <strong>The “I know your name, but I’m blocked” dodge</strong>:<br>
“I keep wanting to call you 'David,' but I know that’s not right.”</p>

<p>2. <strong>The “Of course I know you -- in fact, I want all your information” dodge</strong>:<br>
“Hey, I’d love to get your card.”</p>

<p>3. <strong>The “The tip of my tongue” dodge</strong>:<br>
“I know I know your name, but I’m blanking right now.”</p>

<p>4. <strong>The “You’re brilliant!” dodge</strong>:<br>
“Wow, you have a terrific memory. I can’t believe you remember my name from that meeting six months ago. I can’t remember the names of people I met yesterday! So of course I have to ask you your name.”</p>

<p>5. <strong>The “Sure, I remember you” dodge</strong>:<br>
(Advanced) “Remind me – what’s your last name?” If you ask a person for his last name, he’s likely to repeat both names. “Doe, John Doe.”</p>

<p>6. <strong>The “One-sided introduction” dodge</strong>:<br>
“Hey,” you say to the person whose name you can’t remember, “let me introduce you to Pat Smith.” You introduce the two and say the name of the person whose name you remember. Almost always, the nameless person will volunteer his or her name.</p>

<p>Also, remember that others might have trouble remembering <em>your </em>name. When you’re saying hello to someone, err on the side of re-introducing yourself. “Hi, John, it’s Gretchen Rubin.” Say your name slowly and clearly. And don’t get offended if someone doesn’t remember your name! </p>

<p>How about you? Do you have trouble remembering names? If so, have you found any good strategies for doing a better job of remembering them -- or pretending to remember them?</p>

I'm so interested in clutter -- how to recognize it, how to fight it, and its strangely powerful influence on happiness. It was very fun to see my book on the top of the pile on a bedside table.</p>

<p>Assay: In a novel, a mark of greatness is that a reader can return, over and over, and find something new. I've read Anna Karenina four times, and each time, it has been a different experience. As I am able to bring more to the novel, I take more from it.</p>
<p>This is a mark of greatness even in children's books. You might think that a book written for children would be so simple that it couldn't provide that depth of experience, but that's not true at all.</p>
<p>For instance, over the weekend, I re-read Laura Ingalls Wilder's<em> Little Town on the Prairie</em>. And although I've read that book dozens of times, I loved it just as much as ever, and appreciated it in new ways, yet again.</p>
<p>For instance,  I was struck by a line that I'd never particularly noticed before. The awful Miss Wilder has just sent Laura and Carrie home from school -- a terrible disgrace. As they're walking home to tell their parents what happened, Laura tells Carrie that she's not sorry for the way she behaved, because it was all Miss Wilder's fault. The narrative continues:</p>
<p><strong>"Carrie did not care whose fault it was. There is no comfort anywhere for anyone who dreads to go home."</strong></p>
<p>I've been thinking so much about home lately -- the idea of home, the reality of home -- that this one line hit me with particular force. People's idea of "home" may be very different, but home is one of the keys to happiness.</p>
<p>That's why it seems to me that the effort to make home more homey is so worthwhile. Have you found any good strategies to help ensure that your home is welcoming, so you don't dread going home, but look forward to going home?</p>
<p>* I loved cruising around Inchmark. I wish my daughters' school had "Crazy Hair Day." Maybe we'll do a home version.</p>

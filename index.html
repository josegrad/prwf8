Good-bye! I'm off for a week's vacation. Do you ever feel as if it's more work to take a holiday than it would be just to stay home in your usual routine? I'm in that stage right now, but I know I'll be happy once vacation starts. </p>


<p>As I'm getting ready to leave, I'm reminding myself of my Secrets of Adulthood, family vacation pack:
    </p>
<ul>
<p></p>
<li>Less is more.</li>
	<li>    Start early if possible.</li>
	<li>    When packing an item that might leak, put it in a plastic bag.</li>
	<li>    Don’t let anyone get too hungry. Especially me.</li>
	<li>    Cheerfulness is contagious, and crabbiness is even more contagious.</li>
	<li>    Wear sunscreen.</li>
	<li>    Carry tissues.</li>
	<li>    Remind kids to visit the bathroom—don’t wait for the thought to occur to them.</li>
	<li>    Never choose the buffet option.</li>
	<li>    Get plenty of sleep.</li>
	<li>    There’s joy in routine, but an occasional disruption makes routine all the sweeter.</li>
	<li>    Make it easy to do right, and hard to go wrong.</li>
	<li>    Quit while we’re ahead.</li>
	<li>    Make each of my children helpless with laughter at least once each day.</li>
	<li>    Doing a little work makes goofing off more fun.</li>
	<li>    The things that go wrong often make the best memories.</li>
	<li>    Leave plenty of room in the suitcase.</li>
	<li>    As Eisenhower observed, “Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.”</li>
	<li>    The point is to <em>have </em><em>fun</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Happiness interview: Stephanie Nielson.</p>


<p>Years ago, when I started out out as a blogger, I heard about a popular blog by Stephanie Nielson called the The NieNie Dialogues. Then in 2008, the sad news swept through blogland that Stephanie been in a terrible plane crash. Her body had been 80% burned, and she was in a coma for three month and underwent several major surgeries.</p>


<p>Her memoir of this experience, Heaven Is Here: An Incredible Story of Hope, Triumph, and Everyday Joy is just hitting bookstores. It's a fascinating book on several levels, but I was particularly interested to read it because Stephanie was very happy before the accident, and she explains how she struggled to find her way back to happiness, after the accident. This is obviously one of the most pressing questions about happiness: How do we grapple with a major catastrophe?  </p>

<p>Reading Stephanie's book reminded me of a line that I <em>think </em>(can't swear) comes from ancient Greek literature. If I remember correctly, one of the Greek plays includes a line about "there are some forms of wisdom that one does not pray for." Perhaps Stephanie's experience has given her this kind of wisdom, and perspective on happiness.</p>


<p>Gretchen: <strong>Is there a happiness mantra or motto that you’ve found very helpful? (e.g., I remind myself to “Be Gretchen.”) </strong><br>
Stephanie: I remind myself that there is no such thing as balance in my life. If I want to truly be happy, I put my family first and then figure out how to do everything else. </p>
 

<p><strong>If you’re feeling blue, how do you give yourself a happiness boost? Or, like a “comfort food,” do you have a comfort activity? (mine is reading children’s books). </strong> <br>
I have learned to keep busy. Keeping busy and serving others. I find satisfaction in helping others and realizing when I am blue that someone somewhere (probably just down the street, for all I know) has it worse than me, and I need to snap out of it and find my happiness. I have <em>so</em> much happiness all around me.  I am spoiled.</p>
  

<p><strong>Have you always felt about the same level of happiness, or have you been through a period when you felt exceptionally happy or unhappy—if so, why? If you were unhappy, how did you become happier?</strong><br>
I thought I knew what happiness was, and it was happiness. But since my accident I have a greater meaning of what true happiness is. What truly matters in life, why we are here doing what we are doing, and why it is worth it. I feel thankful for trials that have helped me see perspective. It's not easy, but the lessons learned are always worth it.  
<strong>

<p>Is there some aspect of your home that makes you particularly happy?</p></strong><br>
I love my windows. The windows in my house make everything seem happy and bright.</p>  


<p><strong>Have you ever been surprised that something you expected would make you very happy, didn’t—or vice versa?</strong> <br>
Ironing my sheets. Sure it takes time, and sometimes I really don't want to do it, but when I do it makes me so happy after a long hard day. I love when I take the time to cook a nice meal for my family. I try and make it happen every evening.  I don't think people understand the bonds and happy moments that come when the family can sit down together every night chatting about the day. Good, good memories there—even when my legs are tired and I don't want to. I never regret it.</p>


<p>* I'm in a phase of obsession about color, so I really enjoyed checking out the blog of fabric designer Heather Bailey, Hello My Name Is Heather.</p>

<p> Yesterday, I got a box full of the galleys of Happier at Home. (For you non-publishing industry folk, a galley is a pre-publication, preview copy of a book.)</p>

<p>This should be a thrilling moment, and it <em>was</em> thrilling, but at the same time, for some reason, it sent me into a bit of a panic. I could hardly bring myself to open a book. I get the same feeling when I have a piece run in a newspaper or magazine. Most writers seem to love the moment when they see their work "in print," but not me. I'm not really sure why. Am I afraid of spotting a mistake? Or seeing something that, by this point, I'd do differently? Maybe. </p>

<p>Do you ever experience that? Something that seems to make other people wildly happy—that you think "should" make you happy—for some reason, doesn't?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, getting the galleys is an important marker on the road to publication, so it's exciting as a milestone. And it make me think grateful thoughts, as I do at least fifteen times a day, about <em>how lucky</em> I have work that I love so much. I'm so grateful to have galleys! even if they do make me uneasy.  </p>

<p>Voila!</p>

<p>In books, movies, plays, television, my favorite scenes are often moments of transcendence—when, in the muddle of existence, characters somehow manage to break through everything to engage with each other, and with higher values. </p>

<p>Just off the top of my head, I can think of moments like this from Gilead, The Wire, Friends, Steel Magnolias, the play Bug which has haunted me for years...such moments are the principal subject of Flannery O'Connor.</p>

<p>I also look for them in real life.</p>

<p>For instance, a few weeks ago, I was talking to a bunch of first-year medical students about happiness—mostly, I was pestering them to get enough sleep. At one point, an older doctor jumped into the conversation. "Remember," he said to them earnestly, "you're going to be <em>doctors</em>. That work is really going to bring you a lot of happiness." </p>

<p>This comment lifted the conversation to a new level. Not that I think everyone should be a doctor, but it's true: being a doctor is a rare privilege. To be able to help heal people, and to relieve pain.</p>

<p>This moment reminded me of other times when I felt a moment of transcendence related to people's work. For instance, the way I felt the first time I saw Justice O'Connor wearing her judicial robes. Justice O'Connor is very friendly and kind, but she's a formidable person even at her most casual. Even so, when I saw her wearing those robes, I saw her transformed; I think I actually took a step backward. To be charged to do justice is a very solemn thing, and seeing her in her robes conveyed that point, more powerfully than you might expect.</p>

<p>And I remember when I stopped by the studio of a friend who is a brilliant painter. His studio was everything you'd imagine: skylight, canvases everywhere, plaster models, coffee cans filled with brushes, all of it. </p>

<p>"Wait, I just have to finish one thing," he told me, and he added a few more strokes of paint to a landscape he was working on. </p>

<p>I looked around at everything, so beautiful. "Jacob, you are <em>lucky</em>," I said, in a fierce voice.</p>

<p>"I know," he said. "<em>I know</em>."</p>

<p>In the rush of our daily routines, it's so easy to miss moments of transcendence. In art, they are masterfully presented, with language and emphasis that set them apart like jewels. In ordinary life, they rush by. I try to remind myself to look for them every day.</p>

<p>How about you? How do you remind yourself to look for moments of transcendence in the midst of everyday life?</p>

<em><p>I’m working on my Happiness Project, and you could have one, too! Everyone’s project will look different, but it’s the rare person who can’t benefit. Join in—no need to catch up, just jump in right now. Each Friday’s post will help you think about your own happiness project.</p></em>

<p>* A thoughtful reader sent me the link to Young House Love by Sherry Petersik and John Petersik, because The Happiness Project got a lovely mention in the most recent post. I went to check it out, and spent waaaaay too much time there.</p>

<p>Every Wednesday is Tip Day. <br>
Feeling overwhelmed? <strong>Nine tips for keeping your home feeling serene and organized.</strong></p>

<p>Because of the subject of my next book, Happier at Home, I've been spending a lot of time thinking about—you guessed it!—how to be happier at home. Here are a few very simple suggestions. These aren't the most profound things you can do to make your home feel more serene and organized, but they're steps you can take fairly quickly. </p>

<p>1. <strong>Be wary of bargains, sales, hand-me-downs and give-away</strong>. Do you really need this thing? Or love it? Beware: because of the "endowment effect," we value things more once we own them. Once that thing enters your home, it will be tough to get it out again.</p>

<p>2. <strong>Never label anything “Miscellaneous</strong>.”</p>

<p>3. Remember: <strong>most decisions don’t require extensive research</strong>. Aim to be a satificer, not a maximizer.</p>

<p>4. <strong>Don’t let yourself fall into “empty.</strong>” Keep cash in the house. Keep gas in your tank. Keep an extra roll of toilet paper squirreled away. Keep your phone charged.</p>

<p>5. <strong>Don’t keep excessive amounts of anything</strong>. Those glass vases that come from florists. Those ketchup packets that come with take-out food. A house with two adults probably doesn’t need fifteen mismatched souvenir coffee cups. </p>

<p>6. <strong>Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good</strong>. Lower the bar. Actually spending ten minutes clearing off one shelf is better than fantasizing about spending a weekend cleaning out the basement.</p>

<p>7. <strong>Clean while you cook</strong> (literally and metaphorically).</p>

<p>8. <strong>Put things away in a specific place</strong>. It's much easier to find things later, and it's oddly satisfying to slot things into their precise places. "Ah, this particular basket on this shelf is the place for the AAA batteries." </p>

<p>9. <strong>Make your bed</strong>. I know it sounds trivial, but it's a bigger happiness booster than you'd expect.</p>

<em><p>* Hey everyone: a <strong>New York City-based production company</strong> is looking for <strong>people who've been inspired to start their own Happiness Projects—and who want to share their stories</strong>. Does this describe you? Do you live in the greater NYC/tri-state area? Could you spend a few hours filming, at a convenient time?</p>

<p>If so, email a brief description of yourself, your Happiness Project, and how your life has changed as a result to THNKcasting@radicalmedia.com.</p></em>

<p>On creative collaboration: <br>“Don’t sign on for more problems than you must. Resist the temptation to involve yourself in other people’s zones of expertise and responsibility. Monitor troublesome situations if you need to, but don’t insert yourself unless you’re running out of time and a solution is nowhere in sight. In short, stifle your inner control freak.” <br>
